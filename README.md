## Description
This project reads multiple arrays of integers from a text file,
analyses each array independently and writes detailed results
to an output file.

## Features
- Reads input from a file (`input.txt`)
- Supports multiple arrays (one array per line)
- Calculates:
  - Number of elements
  - Sum of elements
  - Frequency of each element
- Writes results to `output.txt`

## How to Run
1. Place integers in `input.txt` (one array per line)
2. Compile the program:
